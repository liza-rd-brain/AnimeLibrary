  <h1>AnimeLibrary</h1>
</div>

AnimeLibrary is a small pet project for finding info about anime and storing viewed titles.
Also, I am planning to add tagging and some filters for convenience.

After nearly one year of commercial work, I find out lack of practice in handling complex asynchronous tasks. 
In this project, I decided to do back and front both. 
For some simplicity, I took indexedDB for data storage.

Back-end: Node, Puppetier, Express, MaterialUI5.
Front-end: React, TypeScript, Redux.
Other technology: TyrboRepo, CRA.
