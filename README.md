  <h2>Some sad things üòê:</h2>
<div>
  
  1) For today I dont see free account for free server (except lambda, that does not suitable for puppeteer. Yep and vercel doesnt fit).
  Project can be install localy.
  2) Resourse, that i am used doesnt available anymore (https://gogoanime.onl/). And for now, this is just the code you can read. However, it cost me some time and I appreciate all my efforts.

  <h1>AnimeLibrary</h1>
</div>


AnimeLibrary is a pet project for finding info about anime and storing viewed titles.
Also, I am planning to add tagging and some filters for convenience.

After nearly one year of commercial work, I find out lack of practice in handling complex asynchronous tasks. 
In this project, I decided to do back and front both. 
For some simplicity, I took indexedDB for data storage.


  Tech stack:

- Back-end: Node, Puppetier, Express, MaterialUI5.
- Front-end: React, TypeScript, Redux.
- Other technology: TyrboRepo, CRA.
